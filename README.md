# GenericStackandQueueJUnit
It includes JUnit testing cases.
JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java Programming Language. It is important in the test driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit.

JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding", which emphasis on setting up the test data for a piece of code which can be 
tested first and then can be implemented . It increases programmer productivity and stability of program code that reduces programmer stress and the time spent on debugging.

The test cases here are for the Generic Stack and Queue and uses both assertations and annotations.
